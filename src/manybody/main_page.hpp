 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * OpenFCI is a library and program for doing full configuration interaction (FCI)
 * calculations on quantum dots and similar systems. These are the Doxygen-generated
 * documentation pages for OpenFCI. This page is at the moment rather rudimentary,
 * but will be extended continually. The other pages contain a lot more information.
 *
 * For a general introduction to quantum dots, the FCI method, and OpenFCI, see
 *   http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.2644
 *
 * The main program is qdot, see qdot.cc.
 *
 * For small demonstration programs, see pairing.cc, tabulate.cc, radial.cc, and slater_demo.cc.
 *
 * The code is organized in several namespaces: 
 * - manybody : Deals
 *   with generic manybody techniques, such as Slater determinants and
 *   configurational state functions (CSFs).  
 * - gauss : Tools for
 *   Gaussian quadrature and orthogonal polynomials
 * - quantumdot : Sews together concepts from the above namespaces into a quantum dot solver
 *   for parabolic quantum dots.
 * - simple_sparse : Simple implementation of sparse matrices
 * - simple_dense : Simple implementation of dense matrices
 *
